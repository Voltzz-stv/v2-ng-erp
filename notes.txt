NOTE-[GRN record has to be saved in a separate collection.]


DOUBTS-
1) do the sales need multiple select sku's or just one sku at a time?


sku-
    F-Master- (this is a record of all the sku's)
    F-GRN- (this is a record of all the GRN's. This should not be manupulated.)
    F-Stock- (this is a record of all the stock available. This will be updated on each sales.)
